# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression

The project involves data preprocessing, normalization, model creation, training, and predictions. Let me provide a summary of each section and address any potential issues or improvements.

## Task 1: Introduction
You've introduced the project, specifying the features used for predicting house prices and the regression task. You've also mentioned the required libraries and helper functions.

## Task 2: Importing the Data
You've successfully imported the dataset using pandas and displayed the first few rows. Additionally, you checked for missing data, which is good practice.

## Task 3: Data Normalization
Normalization of data is crucial for training machine learning models. You've normalized the data using the mean and standard deviation.

## Task 4: Create Training and Test Sets
You've split the data into training and test sets, ensuring that a portion is kept aside for evaluating the model's performance.

## Task 5: Create the Model
You've defined a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model architecture consists of several dense layers. You've also compiled the model with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Task 6: Model Training
The model training includes early stopping to prevent overfitting. You've trained the model for a specified number of epochs and visualized the training and validation loss.

## Task 7: Predictions
You've made predictions using the trained and untrained models, comparing raw predictions and price predictions. Visualization includes a comparison of predicted prices.

# Suggestions and Potential Improvements:

## Evaluation Metrics:
It would be beneficial to include additional evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R-squared to provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance.

## Data Exploration: 
Consider exploring the data further through descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain insights into feature distributions and correlations.

## Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Experiment with different hyperparameter settings for the neural network architecture to optimize model performance.

## Comments in Code: 
While the code is well-structured, consider adding comments to explain specific sections or steps, making it more understandable for others who might read or collaborate on the code.

## Model Evaluation: 
After training, it's crucial to evaluate the model on the test set and potentially use cross-validation for a more robust assessment.

## Handling Categorical Features: 
If there are categorical features in the dataset, ensure that they are appropriately encoded for input to the neural network.

## Further Analysis: 
Consider exploring feature importance or conducting feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
Remember that the success of a machine learning project also depends on the iterative process of refining and improving the model based on insights gained during exploration and evaluation.
